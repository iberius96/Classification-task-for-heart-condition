    "The initial idea for the development of this projects came from the desire of obtaining a deeper understanding of tree-based algorithms and in how they can be utilized to construct models capable of making predictions in the context of supervised machine learning. One of the best ways to try an have an insight in the inner workings of any algorithm is to make an attempt at the development (from scratch) of a custom version of it. Because of this reason the main focus of this project will be in the development of an implementetion of the CART (Decision Tree) and Random Forest algorithms. Said implementetion will be developed in Python and a baseline will be established using comparable algorithms coming from the Sklearn library in order to assess the general quality of the custom implementetion.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset related to the medical domain (The Cleveland Heart Disease dataset) has been chosen to construct the machine learning models that we are going to use in this project. This particular choice aims at simulating how these types of algorithms could be employed in a real-world scenario. One of the main advantages of tree-based algorithms is their ease of understanding for individuals that are not well versed in the domain of machine learning. The medical field is a perfect example of how Decision Trees could offer an easily understandable solution for medical professionals seeking for help in spotting patients at risk of having an heart condition.\n",

Mean imputation is a type of univariate imputation, because it only takes into account the feature that we are trying to fill in order to come up with the missing data. A more advanced approach to this issue is to use a multivariate imputation algorithm, which instead will take into consideration the whole set of features to perform the estimation.\n",

This is a fairly common occurence when working with medical data, and in our case it means that the `condition` attribute of our training examples will be overrepresented by a majority class (0 in our case) that will cause our model to be slightly biased towards it (i.e. in more extreme cases the model would tend to see the minority class as data noise). \n",

The simplest way to implement oversampling would be to randomly duplicate existing instances of the minority class. A more interesting way to solve this problem is to use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique). Instead of simply duplicating existing data objects, SMOTE will select an object from the minority class. The algorithm will then select another object from the pool of its k-nearest neighbors. A new synthetic example is then created at a random point between the two selected examples. The process is repeated until the classes in the dataset have been balanced.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Section 2.1 - Development of a decision tree algorithm <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm that has been chosen to be implemented for the classification task of this projects is called CART (short for Classification and Regression Trees). An improved version of this algorithm is used by the `DecisionTreeClassifier` and `RandomForestClassifier` of the `sklearn.tree` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CART (Classification and Regression Trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "CART is an algorithm that recursively builds binary trees (branching factor for root and inner nodes = 2) by searching in a partition the combination of feature and threshold values that will maximize the reduction in impurity obtained by splitting a given partition using a selected split candidate. Like many tree-based algorithms (like ID3, C4.5), CART builds the tree structure from the top-down by starting from a `root` partition which containins all the training data. This recursive split (from parent partition to left and right child nodes) is what ultimately allows the algorithm to build the tree structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Searching for a split candidate\n",
    "\n",
    "For each newly created parittion, CART will look at each combination of feature and threshold in order to find a split candidate. For every feature containing `K` different values, we will always have `K-1` possible thresholds. It can also be decided (by changing the value of `max_features`) to search for a split only in a subset of randomly sampled features, this is the default behavior when a tree is initialized from the `RandomForestClassifier` (where `max_features = sqrt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before searching for a possible split, the implemented algorithm will (as a first step) sort the partition entries based on the values of the selected feature. Sorting is fairly expensive, but it allows the algorithm to easily search for all thresholds (within a given feature) in linear time. The algorithm will then proceed to traverse the list of sorted examples and to evaluate all midpoints between two (different) adjecent values as a possible threshold. The reduction in impurity that would be obtained by splitting at the currently selected threshold is compared with the maximum reduction that has been registered so far for the current partition. If the current reduction is bigger than the previous best one, the details of the best split candidate are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stopping condition\n",
    "\n",
    "In CART, the splitting process is recursively repeated for each newly created node until a stopping condition is met. The decision to stop the splitting process for a given node is triggered when: \n",
    "- The partition is pure (i.e. all the examples in the partition have the same class)\n",
    "- No possible split can be imposed to the current partition (i.e. All examples only have a single value per feature)\n",
    "- The (user defined) maximum depth (`max_depth`) has been reached\n",
    "- The threshold for the reduction is impurity (`min_impurity_decrease`) cannot be satisfied by any split candidate\n",
    "- The threshold for the minimum nr of examples needed to split a partition (`min_samples_split`) is not met\n",
    "- The impurity for the current partition is below a given threshold (`min_impurity_split`) \n",
    "- The current partition cannot produce two children with the required minimum nr of entries (`min_samples_leaf`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a stopping condition is reached, the interested partition is turned into a leaf node. Majority voting is performed in order to decide what is the predicted value of the newly created leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Split strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "For this algorithms implementation two strategies have been offered to asses the quality of a split candidate (feature+threshold): `gini` and `entropy`\n",
    "\n",
    "Initializing our `CustomDecisionTreeClassifier` with `criterion = gini` will cause our algorithm to use the Gini Index as a starting metric to evaluate the reduction in impurity brought upon by a given split candidate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini Index for a partition D containing examples with C different classes is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Gini(D) = 1 - \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{C} (p _{i}) ^{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering a split candidate A (feature+threshold) for a partition D, we calculate the weighted sum of impurities of the resulting child partitions D1 and D2 as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Gini _{A} (D) = \\frac{size(D _{1})}{size(D)} Gini(D _{1}) + \\frac{size(D _{2})}{size(D)} Gini(D _{2})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduction of impurity is then simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta Gini(A) = Gini(D) - Gini _{A} (D) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the algorithm can be initialized with `criterion = entropy` to use the Information gain as a metric for the reduction in impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entropy of a partition D containing examples with C different classes is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Entropy(D) = - \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{C} p _{i} log _{2} (p _{i}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The weighted sum of entropies for child partitions D1 and D2 originating from D via a split candidate A is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Entropy _{A} (D) = \\frac{size(D _{1})}{size(D)} Entropy(D _{1}) + \\frac{size(D _{2})}{size(D)} Entropy(D _{2})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Information Gain is then simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Gain(A) = Entropy(D) - Entropy _{A} (D) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times when working with tree based algorithms we end up constructing trees with some branches reflecting anomalies (e.g. outliers) of the data that was used to construct them. This leads to overfitting and hinders the capacity of the model to generalize well to new data. In order to tackle this issue we will use a techingue called pruning. Pruning entails cutting out certain branches of the tree in order to reduce the model size and improve its performance. We distinguish two types of pruning: pre-pruning and post-pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-pruning (or forward pruning or early stopping) is a type of pruning which prevents the creation of non-significant branches. Pre-pruning is achieved by tuning parameters such as `max_depth`, `min_impurity_decrease`, `min_impurity_split`, `min_samples_split` and `min_samples_leaf` to avoid splits that would otherwise occur during the creation of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-pruning is a type of pruning that removes sub-trees (by replacing them with leaf nodes) once they have already been grown. A popular algorithm used for post pruning is the Cost Complexity Pruning algorithm. Due to time constraints, CCP has not been implemented in our custom implementation of the CART algorithm. A section showing how the Sklearn implementation of CCP can be used to improve the performance of a tree-based model can be seen at the end of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partition class\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the structure of a node in our Decision Tree, it has been decided to create a `Partition` class that will contain all the information related to a given node.\n",
    "Root and inner nodes will contain information regarding the chosen split candidate (`split_feature`, `split_value`), the level of impurity (`impurity_part`), the reduction of impurity that has been obtained with the chosen split candidate (`impurity_delta`) and the weighted sum of impurities of the child nodes obtained with the chosen split candidate (`impurity_feature_example`).\n",
    "Additionally, the non-leaf nodes also have populated pointers to their child partitions (`left_part` and `right_part`). This characteristics of the partition class is what allows us to traverse the full-length of the tree by starting from the root node and jumping from child to child until a leaf node is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both root/inner nodes and leaf nodes we have information regarding the predicted class values (`prediction`) which is obtained by majority voting, and the class distribution (i.e. the number of examples for each class value, represented by `counter`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicting a class\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting a class value from a trained model is simply a matter of traversing the three from root to leaf. Non-leaf nodes contain information regarding the feature (`split_feature`) and threshold (`split_value`) we have to check in order to decide if we want to move to the left (example value <= partition threshold) or right (example value > partition threshold) child from the current partition. Once a leaf node is reached, the algorithm stops and checks the predicted value (`prediction`) in order to decide what the predicted class value will be for the current example."

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a way to build binary tree using our implementation of the CART algorithm, we are ready to move a step further by implementing a Random Forest classifier (`CustomRandomForestClassifier`) that will use our `CustomDecisionTreeClassifier` as the basic building block to perform ensemble learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building a forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a forest is a fairly straightforward process in which a set `CustomDecisionTreeClassifier` equal to the value defined by the `n_estimators` parameter are initialized. Using the same input data for all trees and considering the same features for all node splits would create a set of identical models. Since an ensemble of nearly identical trees is fairly useless, Random Forest uses two techniques to ensure that all the models built as part of the forest are slightly different from one another:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Feature randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen in the previous section, setting the `max_features` variable of the `CustomDecisionTreeClassifier` influences how many features are randomly sampled when searching for a potential split in a partition. This particular parameter will allow the algorithm to increment the range of diversity between the trees that are part of the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This random sampling of features is done at the node level, NOT at the tree level. Early implementations of the random forest algorithms used a technique called “random subspace method” where the random subset of features was provided at the tree level:\n",
    "\n",
    ">“Our method relies on an autonomous, pseudo-random procedure to select a small number of dimensions from a given feature space …”\n",
    "\n",
    " - Ho, Tin Kam. “The random subspace method for constructing decision forests.” IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence 20.8 (1998): 832-844\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the implementation shown in this project, modern (state of the art) random forest algorithms use random sampling of features at the node level. This approach allows the algorithm to learn the relationship between different features in a more diversified way. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that each tree can work with the full set of features of the training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to using a random subset of feature for each split, the trees in the Random Forest are also constructed using slightly different training data. This is achieved via a technique called bootstrapping. Bootstrapping uses sampling with replacement to construct a new version of the training dataset for every tree in the forest. Bootstrapping entails randomly sampling examples from the original dataset until a ratio size (`max_samples`) is reached. Sampling with replacement simply means that the same entries can be sampled multiple times from the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicting a class (Aggregation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all the models in the forest have been constructed, we can start predicting labels for new data.\n",
    "The technique used by the Random Forest algorithm to predict a class label is pretty straightforward. The algorithm will run the prediction (exapleined in the previous section) for every tree in the forest. Majority voting is then applied on the list of predictions and the most frequent class value is then chosen as the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees tend to be low-bias, high-variance models. This is the reason why, when building a single decision tree, employing pruning techniques is usually helpful in order to remove those branches that reflect noise and outliers in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest uses feature randomness and bagging to \"de-correlate\" trees so that they are not overly similar. Predictions are then made considering all trees in the ensemble. This has the effect of mitigating this high variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Because of this reason, the benefits of emplying pruning techniques are usually greatly reduced when working with a Random Forest."

    "In order to improve the performance of our model and fully utilize the hyperparameters that we have implemented in our custom algorithms, we will use a technique called grid search. GridSearchCV takes as input a `param_grid` (which is a dictionary containing a list of hyperparameters together with the values they can take), an estimator (i.e. the classifier that we want to tune), the training set, a scoring function and the nr of folds we want to use in our K-fold cross validation. The algorithm tries all possible hyperparameters combinations from the values specified in our `param_grid` and returns the estimator that yielded the best result based on the chosen scoring metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, GridSearchCV uses K-fold cross validation to evaluate each model. Using this approach the dataset is split into K subsets (folds). The model is then built on K-1 (training) folds and scored on the last one. The process is repeated until all folds have been used for testing. The final score of the given model is an average across all iterations.\n",
