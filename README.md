### Brief Description

The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset originally published in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains a snapshot of the clinical profile on admission to the hospital of more than 300 patients, together with a label indicating if an heart condition was discovered after admission.

### Features

- age: Age in years
- sex: Sex
    - Value 0: female 
    - Value 1: male
- cp: Chest pain type
    - Value 0: typical angina
        - Meets all three of the following characteristics:
            - Substernal chest discomfort of characteristic quality and duration
            - Provoked by exertion or emotional stress
            - Relieved by rest and/or nitroglycerine
    - Value 1: atypical angina
        - Meets two out of the three characteristics
    - Value 2: non-anginal pain
        - Meets one or none of the three characteristics
    - Value 3: asymptomatic
- trestbps: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg (millimiters of mercury) on admission to the hospital
- chol: Serum cholestoral in mg/dl
- fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl 
    - Value 0 = false
    - Value 1 = true
- restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results
    - Value 0: normal
    - Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    - Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy (left pumping chamber that has thickened and may not be pumping efficiently) by Estes' criteria
- thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
- exang: Exercise induced angina 
    - Value 0 = no
    - Value 1 = yes
- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    - Value 0: upsloping
    - Value 1: flat
    - Value 2: downsloping
- ca: number of major vessels colored by flourosopy
- thal: Thalassemia (blood disorder in which the body makes an abnormal form or inadequate amount of hemoglobin)
    - Value 0: normal 
    - Value 1: fixed defect
    - Value 2: reversable defect
- Condition: 
    - Value 0: heart condition not present 
    - Value 1: heart condition present
